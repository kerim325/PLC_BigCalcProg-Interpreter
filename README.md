# BigCalcProg Interpreter

BigCalcProg is an extended interpreter for processing programs with enhanced functionality. It is built using ANTLR for Programming Languages and Concepts (PLC) at University of Vienna.

## Features

1. **Variable Assignments**: The interpreter supports variable assignments using the '=' operator. Variables can be alphanumeric but must start with a letter.

2. **Arithmetic Operations**: The interpreter supports basic arithmetic operations including addition ('+'), subtraction ('-'), multiplication ('*'), and division ('/').

3. **Expressions**: The interpreter can evaluate complex expressions that include a combination of variables, numbers, and arithmetic operations. Expressions can be nested using parentheses.

4. **Whitespace and Comment Handling**: The interpreter is capable of ignoring whitespaces and comments. Both block comments (/*...*/) and line comments (//...) are supported.

5. **Error Handling**: The interpreter is designed to handle and report syntax errors.

6. **EOF Handling**: The interpreter recognizes the end of the file, allowing it to process complete programs.
